# hsc-starter-theme

This will eventually be my own personal starter theme for WordPress projects with all of my go-to defaults on the front-end.

DEFAULTS:
- NPM
- Gulp
- Sass/SCSS
- FontAwesome
- Carousel/Slider plugin (not sure which one)
- minireset.css
- hamburgers.css

FUTURE:
- CSS Grid prioritized for layouts, 
- Pre-made tempaltes  so each starter theme has a USEFUL template for typical websites.. 
 - Home page (general_full-width)
 - About (general_fixed-width)
 - Single (single-post)
 - Archive (posts-archive)
